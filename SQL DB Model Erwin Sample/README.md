Datamodel::sample
================

Sample of my data-modeling work. I have uploaded an Erwin file and data-work flow document. This might be useful for 
a traditional (SQL) DB. For NOSQL databases such as Mongo DB, which uses JSON/BSON format this will not work.


Note: CA ERwin Data Modeler (ERwin) is a software tool for data modeling (data requirements analysis, database design etc.) 
of custom developed information systems, including databases of transactional systems and data marts. ERwin's data modeling 
engine is based upon the IDEF1X method, although it now supports diagrams displayed with information engineering notation 
as well.
